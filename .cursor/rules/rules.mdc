Use only popular, stable and well-supported libraries. Prefer the Python standard library.

Keep dependencies to a minimum. Do not add a library for trivial tasks.

Use the simplest possible architecture that solves the problem. Avoid unnecessary layers and patterns.

Always follow Python best practices and PEP8 in all code.

Always add type hints for all function and method arguments and return values.

Write Russian docstrings for every module, class, function and important variable.

Add detailed comments for any complex logic, non-trivial loops and calculations. Explain what and why.

Split logic into small, clear functions. Avoid long, monolithic functions.

Do not generate boilerplate or placeholder code. All code must be complete and runnable.

Prefer explicit and readable code over clever one-liners. Readability is more important than brevity.

Avoid magic numbers and strings; use named constants with a short Russian comment.

Use only widely adopted, stable Python versions and language features. Avoid experimental features.


When requirements are unclear, choose the simplest reasonable implementation instead of over-engineering.

Explain important design decisions in short Russian comments near the code.

Prefer pure functions where possible; keep side effects explicit.

If performance trade-offs exist, choose clarity first and mention possible optimizations in comments.

Keep modules focused on a single responsibility; avoid mixing unrelated logic in one file.

Use clear, descriptive English names for identifiers; avoid abbreviations except very common ones.

Whenever you show code, include minimal usage examples that can be run as-is.
